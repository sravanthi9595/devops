 TITLE                     :   Cloud Security Through AES with Verifiable Outsourcing of Key Updates
 MEMBERS             :   4
 ROLE                      :   Team Leader
DESCRIPTION       :
                In my Project, I focus on how to make the key updates as transparent as possible for the client. In this paradigm, key updates can be safely outsourced to some authorized party, and thus the key update burden on the client will be kept minimal. I leverage third party auditor (TPA) in many existing public security designs, let it play the role of authorized party in our case and make it in charge of both the storage security and secure key updates for key-exposure resistance.
